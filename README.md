# Low-Transistor-4x4-Multiplier-with-Novel-4T-Half-Adder-and-6T-Full-Adder-Designs
This project presents a compact and transistor-efficient 4x4 multiplier architecture, utilizing novel custom-designed 4-transistor half adders and 6-transistor full adders. The architecture is optimized for low-area VLSI implementations while maintaining full functional correctness and scalability.
